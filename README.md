# rob-jetson software package on the Jetson Orin Nano

To get all the contents of submodules, if this 'rob-jetson' repo was just cloned, run:
```bash
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:robchair/rob-jetson.git
cd rob-jetson
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
* No git submodules as of current

# To run voice control but with ROS2, do the following:

```bash
source ~/rob/roboVoice/venv/bin/activate
cd ~/rob/rob_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch wheelchair_bringup mvp.launch.py # Only need to run this one if no changes were made since last build

```

# To activate keyboard control:

```bash
# In another terminal while the mvp.launch.py is running with ROS2 run:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/rob/rob_ws/install/setup.bash
source ~/rob/roboVoice/venv/bin/activate

ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r cmd_vel:=/cmd_vel_keyboard
```
* Next step: maybe make keyboard launch automatically by editing `mvp.launch.py`?
* TODO: Make the keyboard controls have persistence until another control is given (right now motors stop after 0.5s).
